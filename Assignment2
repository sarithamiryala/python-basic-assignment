 7.spam = 0 
   in 1st if condition spam is not 10. nothing is printed
   in 2nd if condition spam is not grater than 5, so it will go fro else and print
   'ham'
   'spam'
   'spam'
   
  8. if spam ==1:

 11. range(10) = 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
     range(0,10) = 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
     range(0,10,1) = 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
 
 12. for i in range(1,11,1):
         print(i)
         x = 1
     while x<=10:
           print(x)
           x = x+1
